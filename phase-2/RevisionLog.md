Revision of the deliverables presented in the 1st phase	
in the project phase 1 we receive only 1 comment. 
DFD lv 0 should have only 1 process and donâ€™t need a data store. Every process must pass the State Railway of Thailand system. According to the comment, the data store of the application should be part of the system. So, we merge all the things into the process (State Railway of Thailand Cashless System)
